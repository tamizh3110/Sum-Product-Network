# Sum-Product-Network
Sum Product Network are deep probabilistic model which are used to provide inferences based on input arguments. They have unbounded tree width and follow a bottom-up approach. The input begins from the bottom and goes through a series of sums and product where the sum denotes dependency while the product denotes independency. Thus SPN can capture both the dependency and independency between input arguments and can efficiently provide probability values. SPN can also be quite compared to a simple neural network where the learning process of an SPN involves stochastic gradient descent or Expectation maximization and back-propogation.Link to the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3732]
